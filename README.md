## Brief
The TINY Language Compiler is a project that implements a custom compiler for the TINY programming language. It consists of three main phases: Scanner, Analyzer, and Code Generation. Each phase contributes to the compilation process, transforming TINY source code into executable instructions.

The Scanner tokenizes the input source code, identifying keywords, identifiers, and symbols. The Analyzer checks the syntactic and semantic correctness of the code, building an abstract syntax tree (AST) to represent the program structure. The Code Generation phase translates the AST into low-level instructions suitable for execution on a virtual machine.
The project emphasizes modular compiler design, efficient error handling, and extensibility for future language features. It demonstrates a deep understanding of parsing techniques, symbol table management, and intermediate code optimization.
